# Choose a Unique Identifier for Lab Objects

- In the labs you will be creating some objects that require a unique name
- Choose and make note of a prefix that you can use for these objects
- We recommend using your first 1 or 2 initials, your last name, and the number of this course: 40441
- For example, a prefix might be dcwalls40441
- WHen you create a server for Azure SQL Databases, you would name it dcwalls40441.databases.windows.net
